        <br>Panchenko Ilya was born in Sicily in 1887.
        <br>Ilya grew up with his best friend Frank Vinci and they almost always did everything together.
        <br>When both turned 20, they decided to move to America, where Panchenko began to train and take part in fights for money,
        <br>Vinci also began to settle in the "circle" of the mafia. A couple of years later, Panchenko became a professional fighter and champion.
        <br>But Vinci did not waste time either - by 1931 he had founded his family, and Ilya offered the position of his consigliere, and Panchenko agreed.
        <br>But after a couple of months, Vinci decided to make good money on bootlegging and ordered Leo to take up this business.
        <br>In 1943, Panchenko was arrested for "purchased" fights and sentenced to five years in prison.
        <br>In prison, he became a respected person, right after the head of the prison, with whom Ilya got along well.
        <br>There, Ilya organized training fights and, based on his experience, began to teach other “convicts” new tricks.
        <br>It was there that Panchenko met his new assistant, Pepe, who was his best fighter among the rest.
